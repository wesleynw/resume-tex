    \textit{Hone Health -- New York, NY}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a dashboard project with a C\#/.NET backend \& Next.js frontend to organize and visualize patient data and analyze their movement/trajectory through their customer journey with lab results and doctor's appointments.
        \item Worked on a team to implement features, fix bugs in real-time, and manage platform stability through Azure DevOps in a quickly expanding start-up environment.
        \item Took on responsibilities for website redesign and brand refresh, collaborated with designers to restructure app design.
    \end{itemize}
    \textit{Highlights:} C\#/.NET, Next.js, Azure \& Azure DevOps, Redis, CustomerIO, \& Hangfire \\


    \textbf{Computer \& Data Science Student Researcher} \hfill January 2023 -- May 2023 \\
    \textit{Under Professor Johnathan Marshall}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed classifiers and statistical models to identify patterns and anomalies in historical crime data.
        \item Constructed XML parsers to parse cases and to ensure old, irregular data was interoperable with Pandas/NumPy.
        \item Employed Text Data Mining \& Analytics to make conclusions about and to verify hypotheses about the data.
    \end{itemize}

\header{PROJECTS}

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}



    \textbf{Full-Stack Todo List \& Scheduling App -- React, Node.js, MongoDB} \hfill Fall 2023

    \textit{Personal Project}, available at \href{https://wesleyweisenberger.xyz}{wesleyweisenberger.xyz}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Seamless account creation \& login, session management handled by JSON Web Tokens, and a secure REST API backend that persists data in MongoDB, with data automatically being refreshed across signed-in devices.
        \item Intuitive, accessible, \& dynamic frontend built from scratch allows users to add tasks with customizable due date and priority options, and later remove, sort, \& edit these tasks with attention paid to responsive layouts on mobile devices.
        \item Self hosted on DigitalOcean as a custom configured production server using Nginx \& Let's Encrypt.
    \end{itemize}



    \vspace{1mm}



    % \noindent \textbf{Weather Station \& Online Monitor/Visualizer -- C, HTML, Javascript} \hfill Spring 2021

    % \textit{Personal Project}

    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Constructed a custom battery-powered Arduino weather monitoring circuit \& system which pushed environmental data to a database on a locally hosted Linux web server, accessible to the internet.
    %     \item Website allowed users to monitor and visualize weather data \& trends. Users also had the ability to request more recent weather measurements from the device.
    % \end{itemize}

    \textbf{End to End Encrypted File Sharing System -- Go} \hfill Spring 2023

    \textit{Class Project}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and developed an API that allows users to upload, append to, and delete files.
        \item API also supports secure file sharing between users and revocation of file access.
        \item Custom suite of tests written to ensure that file integrity and confidentiality were maintained even after any malicious actions were taken on the server.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{1mm}

    % \textbf{Gitlet -- Java} \hfill Fall 2021

    % \textit{Class Project}
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Custom version control system with functionality modeled after Git.
